1.1

1. 
It takes about 500 iterations for there to be a consistent
ERROR for any amount of threads greater than 1. At this many
iterations, it is likely that threads will overlap each other
when they are doings the adds, and some of the adds will be
ignored, thus making the count not equal 0.

THe number of threads needed to to make the program consistently
fail depends greatly on the iterations. If your iterations have
a value less than 10, you can run almost as many threads as you
would like. The less threads there are, the less likely there
will be an overlap between them, so it will fail less.

2. If the number of iterations is very low, then each thread
will run for a significantly short amount of time, so the
probability of each thread overlapping each other is minimized.
