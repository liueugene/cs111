Only implemented up to Lab 1a spec (--rdonly, --wronly, --command, --verbose)
http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs111/assign/lab1.html


* File to open with --rdonly or --wronly must already exist
* Must open at least one file via --rdonly or --wronly before running --command
* Giving --rdonly or --wronly too many arguments will not open any file
* --wait is not implemented - After command is run in the child process, the parent process does not wait for the child to finish
